Note: This is a sample Landing Page / Referral Marketing portal for SolarCity Ambassadors to have their friends, neighbors, coworkers, etc. indicate an interest in solar energy. I had the opportunity to work with [Jon Carson](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/author/jon-carson), formerly of the White House, on our [Ambassador Marketing program](https://seekingalpha.com/article/3322025-solarcitys-solar-ambassador-program-is-exploding), now at 150,000+ Ambassadors strong.

[GO HERE](http://share.solarcity.com/henrybv) to see the most current iteration of the Landing Page/ Ambassador portal (built with Angular/ React, Node, Express, JavaScript, MongoDB)

# SolarCity Lead Capture Form

### To start the application

1. Install node packages: `npm install`
2. Start up server and data processes: `npm start` and `mongod`
3. View in browser at http://localhost:1337

Full-stack Application
=====================================================

Sample landing page/ lead form for potential customers to indicate interest in solar energy.

I built a Full-stack Application, using MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js), a framework I have worked with extensively the past year.


### Back-end

1. Express + middleware functions to provide abstract layer on top of NodeJS

2. MongoDB: Database set up that allows me to easily and expressively model user info my application.

Having the same basic data model in my code & database dramatically simplifies the task of application development, and eliminates the layers of complex mapping code otherwise required. MongoDB also makes it easy to evolve the structure of form data over time.

Models and Routes are set up accordingly in server/app and db/models.


### Front-end

3. Bootstrap: quick, easy set up, mobile responsive

4. Angular:

Having built many MEAN stack apps for web and mobile, I chose AngularJS.
Angular's two-way data binding nature is perfect for building our Lead Form. 

User Controller + Factory were created as separate JS files (in browser/js/user) to make code easier to read, scale & maintain in the future.

5. Slideshow Feature: 

Many custom CSS stylings here. A visually attractive gallery of images is important to help customers visualize their home with solar. I included solar home pictures from 6 states.

6. User Lead Form itself: 

ng-model allows data-binding to different fields in lead form (leadToSubmit). Upon successful submission, Lead and Form are both reset.


### Other technologies

7. Chalk, Morgan, Nodemon, serve-favicon, body-parser etc. - 

I strive to make this as close to a production app as possible.

8. Babel, ES6. Bluebird, because ES 6 is fun and also I believe in clean code (hence promises).


### Extra features to add

1. Salesforce integration
2. Sendgrid email integration (Easy to implement. An email upon successful submission -> Create sense of excitement for customers)
3. Near Me map: of neighbors with solar -> Highlight growth rate & create sense of urgency.
4. Add Referrer Model > New referral lead is tied to their Referrer. 
5. More form validation & helper messages.
6. Write tests.


# My experience as an Energy Consultant & Solar Ambassador

Referral is a mindset. By mentioning Solar Ambassador program early in Lead Form, this helps ECs build trust w/ customers. In my experience, customers will also more likely refer in the future.

I joined SolarCity with an employee referral from Jon Carson, formerly of the White House, and our Sr. Director of Ambassadors. Because of my affinity with the Ambassador team, I also helped lead several local pilot programs, including Solar Open House and Solar Party.

In 2015, I also helped Katie DeWitt and the product team with Dynamo Sales pilot.
